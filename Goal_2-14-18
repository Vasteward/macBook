### Set the Stage
Currently, I am learning how to create semantic HTML, a CSS style sheet, and how to link them. Learning how to do this is instrumental to becoming an efficient web dev as it will help other programs understand my code and help me create aesthetic web pages. 
My process of setting the stage includes several steps and utilizing a couple of resources. It is important to state that I use my computer for the sole purpose of web developement. I do not have social media on my computer nor do I shop or use this computer to do any unrelated tasks. This keeps me focused. The first few steps that take are writing SMART goals for the day and then setting up my desktops for easy access and functionality. The resources that I use include the 'Tomato timer' and 'Youtube' to listen to chill hiphop beats. 
### Reflection
When engaging with new tech, I like to play around with the different settings to see what it can do. As for right now, I try not to dally, so I don't play as much as I'd like. However, for me it's imperative so I understand the capability of the technology. Thus, in the future, I plan on spending a considerable amount of my weekend to brush up on any new tech. As far as where I hope to go with the new technology that I will learn, I just want to add it to my bat belt so I can better handle any situation that may arise. The more options you have the better your choices which allows you to make the best selection.

JavaScript

### Set the Stage
I am going to focus the majority of my attention on JavaScript, as that is where the class seems to be. I do not want to miss out on any of the breakouts and risk being left behind any further than I feel that I am already. Javascript is a basic programming language with many capabilities that will get me in the groove understanding the functionality of programming. I have decided to read all of the material within Galvanize dedicated to JavaScript, as well as take the Code Academy course for reinforcement. I think once I have completed the Code Academy course and read through the resources I will be able to complete the "Use basic programming skills to solve problems" drills with ease. The same resources that I mentioned before will be utilized(SMART goals, tomato timer, chillhop, desktop layout). Experience working with the technology will be gained through the drills. 

### Reflection
I will need to play with the tech a bit more so I can grasp a good handle of the material. By not playing with it, this morning's teaser was a bit complicated. I hope to solve basic problems and even more in-depth ones especially when it comes to the tech interviews.
