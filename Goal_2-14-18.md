At the beginning of a day, write 2-5 goals you want to achieve today. At the end of the day, reflect in writing on your progress toward meeting your goals. Look at the rubric for more specific information. 

  ## Rubric

In order to craft daily goals that help you become a better developer, your goals must be ambitious, yet feasible and describe *how* to get the work done.

### Goals

- [ ] The beginning of the reflection includes 2-5 measurable goals that were set at the beginning of the day
  Actionable goals are SMART:
  - [ ] **S**pecific
  - [ ] **M**easurable: At the end of a specified time period, it is easy to determine whether or not the goal has been met
  - [ ] **A**chievable: It is possible to attain your daily goal
  - [ ] **R**ealistic 
  - [ ] **T**imely: Your goals are what you need to learn now. 

### Reflection

The following questions are answered in writing:
  - [ ] Were the goals met? Yes or no.
  - [ ] What went well? The student describes at least 2 successful actions and describes _why_ these actions were a 'win.'
  - [ ] What didn't go well? The student describes at least 1 action that was not a success and  describes _why_ the goal wasn't met.

##Reflection
Not all of my goals were met, I was able to complete the subset goals of my first goal, complete goal 2, complete goal 3, and complete 2 of the 7 of goal 4. I spreaded myself a bit too thin, as I focused on the build multi-pages and the javascript on Wednesday when I should've focused on just one major topic for the day. I went to the Native Array Methods and was able to understand what was being taught and followed in up with the Arrays reading from Learn. This helped solidify my knowledge. The followig day, I will have one major focus and if I get stuck I can vascilate or move on once I am complete with one task. 

## Week goal
1.) Complete all of the "Build multi-page websites" drills by Wednesday
+ Complete a drill a day
+ Practice Flexbox and Grid each day (30min a dat)

2.) Increase typing speed by 3wpm by the end of the week
+ Practice typing every other day

3.) Complete all of the critical learn-to-learn techniques by Friday
